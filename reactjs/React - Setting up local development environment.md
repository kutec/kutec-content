I was thinking of learning about Reactjs from last more than a year.

But somehow I couldn't begin with it. I know it's too late but finally, I make up my mind towards that, and this is the very first post in the Reactjs category.  

I have done tons of projects in Angular but never got the opportunity to work on a React project. So I've decided to create dummy projects at the end of the whole learning.  

Let's begin now.

To start with any development project, we need to setup a development enviorment. Nowadays, there are many online IDE are poular where project setup can be done instantly. However, I personally prefer the local development setup for most of the projects.


## Reactjs - Local Development Environment

First, we need a a local development environment. (I work in Windows OS, so all the steps would be in that context only).
