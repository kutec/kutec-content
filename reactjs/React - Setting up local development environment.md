I was thinking of learning about Reactjs from last more than a year.

But somehow I couldn't begin with it. I know it's too late but finally, I make up my mind towards that, and this is the very first post in the Reactjs category.  

I have done tons of projects in Angular but never got the opportunity to work on a React project. So I've decided to create dummy projects at the end of the whole learning.  

Let's begin now.

To start with any development project, we need to setup a development enviorment. Nowadays, there are many poular online IDEs available where project-setup can be done instantly. However, I personally prefer the local development setup for most of the projects.


## Reactjs - Local Development Environment

<small>I work in Windows OS, so all the steps below, would be in that context only.</small>

#### Step 1 - Install `create-react-app` gloabally:
```
npm i create-react-app -g
```
#### Step 2 - Create a new Reactjs project
```
npx create-react-app my-app // OR
cd my-app
npm start
```
