Back when I first started coding HTML, I treated every webpage like a stack of LEGO blocks—just throw a bunch of  `<div>`s and  `<span>`s together until it  _looked_  right. Semantics? Accessibility? "That’s for the fancy developers," I thought.

Then I actually learned about  **HTML5’s semantic tags**, and—well—it was like realizing I’d been writing in all caps my whole life. Turns out,  `<header>`  isn’t just a "fancier  `<div>`," and  `<nav>`  does more than make your code  _look_  organized.

### Why Bother?

-   **SEO quietly cheers**  when you use  `<article>`  instead of  `<div id="post">`.
    
-   Screen readers  **actually understand**  `<main>`  vs.  `<div class="content">`.
    
-   Future-you (or your teammates) won’t have to decode a nest of  `<div class="wrapper-inner-wrapper">`.
    

In this guide, I’ll walk through:

1.  **The tags I actually use**  (and which ones I ignore).
    
2.  **Real-world tradeoffs**  (because sometimes a  `<div>`  _is_  fine).
    
3.  **How to fix old code**  without rewriting everything.
    

No jargon, no fluff—just stuff that works. Let’s dive in.
