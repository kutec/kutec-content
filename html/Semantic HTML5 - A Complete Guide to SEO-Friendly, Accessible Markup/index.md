Back when I first started coding HTML, I treated every webpage like a stack of LEGO blocks—just throw a bunch of `<div>`s and `<span>`s together until it looked right. Semantics? Accessibility? "That’s for the fancy developers," I thought.  
  
Then I actually learned about HTML5’s semantic tags, and—well—it was like realizing I’d been writing in all caps my whole life. Turns out, <header> isn’t just a "fancier <div>," and <nav> does more than make your code look organized.  
  
Why Bother?  
SEO quietly cheers when you use <article> instead of <div id="post">.  
  
Screen readers actually understand <main> vs. <div class="content">.  
  
Future-you (or your teammates) won’t have to decode a nest of <div class="wrapper-inner-wrapper">.  
  
In this guide, I’ll walk through:
